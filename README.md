# HTML and CSS - Course Assignment - RainyDays

Rainy Days: Intro project using HTML and CSS, based on a Figma design for an online rain jacket store.

## Description

This was our first project using HTML and CSS to build a web-application based on a design we made in Figma. We could choose between 3 briefs. RainyDays, an online shop selling men's and womenâ€™s rain jackets. SquareEyes, a video streaming website. GameHub, an online shop where users can purchase computer games. This is my RainyDays interpretation.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

### Installing

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vold-Art/html-css-vold.git
```

```
No dependencies
```

### Running

Since this is a static website using only HTML and CSS, you can run it by simply opening the index.html file in your browser:

Option 1:

Open index.html directly in your browser.

Option 2 (recommended for local development):

Use a live server in your code editor (e.g. Live Server extension in VS Code) to serve the files locally.
